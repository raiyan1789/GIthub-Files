    <h1>An Overview of HTML With P5</h1>
    <p>HTML is a markup language used to describe the "flow" or structure of a web page.</p>
    <p>Elements are used to describe content to be placed on the page. Elements are denoted by tags.</p>
    <p>The heading and paragraph above were created using HTML. The image below was created using P5.</p>
    <p>HTML is written in the HTML page, saved as index.html (or other given name). It is linked to the P5 code via the script tag in the HTML document.</p>
    <p>Libraries extend the functionality of software. In this case, the DOM library is used to extend HTML features.</p>
    <p>Notice included files have extensions like .js and .html. It indicates the kind of files such as javascript and html.</p>
    <p>The page is not heavily styled. Besides a few margin, padding and alignment settings, it uses default settings from the browser used to view it.</p>
    <p>Styles can be linked to a CSS document in the HTML document. Styles can also be included inline in the HTML document or written in the header.</p>
